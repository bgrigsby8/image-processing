color_correction.py
--------------------
A Viam camera component that color-corrects images from a source camera using
a 3x3 Color Correction Matrix (CCM) fitted from a Calibrite / X-Rite
ColorChecker Classic.

Two ways to get corrected images out of this component:

1. Streaming path - ``get_images`` proxies the source camera, applies the CCM
   to every JPEG/PNG frame, and returns the corrected images (names preserved).
   This is what the control tab, data manager, and vision services use.

2. DoCommand path - the studio RAW workflow, for cameras (the PTP model, or
   the Canon CCAPI module) whose full-resolution stills are exposed through
   DoCommand rather than the streaming ``Images`` method:

       {"capture": {"white_balance": "camera",
                    "output_formats": ["tiff16", "jpeg"]}}
           -> trigger a still on the source camera; if it's a RAW (CR3/NEF/...)
              downloaded to disk, demosaic it to 16-bit *linear*, apply white
              balance + the CCM, and write rendered exports next to it - leaving
              the RAW untouched as the master. Returns the export paths, a JSON
              sidecar path recording the development, and a small base64 JPEG
              preview (the full image stays on disk).

   The source still arrives either inline as ``image_base64`` (small JPEGs from
   CCAPI) or as a downloaded file path in ``saved_to`` - the PTP RAW handoff.
   Wire the PTP component as this model's ``camera`` dependency and give PTP a
   ``download_dir`` so its captures land on disk where this model can read them.

       {"capture": {"defer": true}}
       {"capture_result": {"id": "<capture_id>", "wait_sec": 60}}
           -> pipelined capture for rigs that move between shots: ``capture``
              with ``defer`` returns {"capture_id", "status", "camera_path"}
              as soon as the shutter has fired (exposure done - the rig is
              free to move), while the USB download, half-size demosaic, CCM,
              and preview encode continue in the background.
              ``capture_result`` then returns {"source_path", "image_base64",
              ...} (or {"status": "pending"} if not done within ``wait_sec``).
              Deferred captures never write exports or a sidecar - run
              ``develop`` on the returned ``source_path`` when the files are
              actually needed. Requires the ptp model (its ``trigger``
              command) as the source camera.

   This is a non-destructive, Capture One-style pipeline: 16-bit linear math,
   no auto-brightness, the original RAW preserved, adjustments recorded in a
   sidecar. See image_io.py for the decode/export details and color-space notes.

   Relevant config attributes: ``output_dir`` (default: next to the source),
   ``output_formats`` (default ["tiff16", "jpeg", "png16", "png8"]),
   ``jpeg_quality`` (95), ``white_balance`` ("camera"), ``exposure_stops`` (0.0 -
   paste the value `calibrate_color` reports to render at the calibrated
   brightness), ``tone`` ("none" - delivery look: "none" is colour-accurate /
   colorimetric, "medium"/"bright" lift the midtones for a Capture One-style
   punch), ``sharpen`` ("none" - capture sharpening: "light"/"medium"/"strong",
   since RAW is soft before sharpening), ``demosaic`` ("DHT" - RAW demosaic
   algorithm, sharper than libraw's stock AHD), ``write_sidecar`` (true),
   ``delete_after_upload`` (false).

       {"develop": {"path": "/photos/IMG_0042.CR3"}}
       {"develop": {"paths": ["/photos/a.CR3", "/photos/b.CR3"]}}
           -> develop existing RAW/image file(s) already on disk through the
              same pipeline, with no camera trigger. Takes the same
              white_balance / exposure_stops / output_formats / output_dir
              options as ``capture``. A single ``path`` returns that file's
              result; ``paths`` returns {"developed": [...], "count": N}.

       {"delete": {"paths": ["/photos/a.CR3", "/photos/a.jpg"]}}
           -> remove files from this machine's disk: skipped captures the
              operator discarded, or sets already safe in the cloud. Guarded -
              only files inside the configured ``output_dir`` can be deleted.
              For kept shots, prefer ``delete_after_upload`` (config attribute
              or per-``upload`` option), which removes each file only after
              its upload succeeds.

Calibration:

       {"calibrate_color": {}}
           -> grab a live-view frame, auto-detect the ColorChecker (cv2.mcc),
              fit a CCM, and return it. No white balance (no RAW from live view).
       {"calibrate_color": {"use_capture": true}}
           -> trigger a full-resolution RAW still, auto-detect the chart,
              measure white balance from the raw CFA under the neutral patches
              ([r,g,b,g2] for rawpy's user_wb), and fit the CCM under that same
              white balance. Returns both.
       {"calibrate_color": {"path": "/photos/chart.CR3"}}
           -> same, from a RAW already on disk (no camera trigger).

The chart is detected automatically anywhere in frame (cv2.mcc, from
opencv-contrib) - no clicking patch centres. Pass ``patch_centers`` (24 [x,y])
to override detection, or ``compute_wb: false`` to skip white balance.
`calibrate_color` returns the fitted 3x3 ``ccm`` and the 4-value
``white_balance``; copy them into the component's ``ccm`` / ``white_balance``
config attributes to make the calibration persist across restarts.
